### Repo structure
When creating a branch for the issue you are working on please name it using the following convention: issue#(number of issue)-(name of issue).
Every branch you create for the different mechanics will be merged into develop where all the mechanics will be tested together to see if the system works as a whole.
After we verify that everything works properly it will be merged into main. Before one merges their branch into develop it will be looked over by another team member just for safety. Branches of the issues that have been solved/tested/merged into main will be deleted.
To see which issue you have to implement check either the issues tab in here or go on trello and check.
